# The Background

We have a CSV file containing address data for our customer companies. You can find it here: [data-sample.csv](data-sample.csv).

We asked a freelance developer to create a simple application (using a static dataset for now) that outputs address records in various formats.

Parsing the CSV file will be one of the next features to implement, but for now, we simply wanted to evaluate how the data formatting works.

The developer delivered a solution and instructed us to run the `cli.php` script to view the formatted output.

We're very happy with the results we see on screen — it's exactly what we were hoping for. However, we're unsure about the code quality and whether it will be maintainable in the long term.

In the future, we plan to add other output formats — potentially dozens, depending on our employees' needs.

# The Task

Please take a look at the source code in the `src/` directory and share your feedback. We believe the code is fine, as it performs well, but since we’re not developers, there might be things we’ve missed that could be improved.

You're welcome to run the script, but it's not required. Just a few comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Many thanks in advance!
